# BuddyWatch
A simple Minecraft Spigot plugin to display the coordinates to your buddy.

# Intro
I created this plugin for my buddy (Xeron998) and myself. Often times we'd be out exploring and we get lost from each other. We wanted a way to see where the other person was to be able to navigate back to them.

This plugin will show the targeted player's location, with the options to display health, experience level, and the world.

# Future Features

# Caveats
* The scores will re-arrange themselves on the board in order of decreasing value. This is a limitation of the native Scoreboard API within Minecraft.
